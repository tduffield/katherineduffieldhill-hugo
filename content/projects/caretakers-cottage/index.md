The Zilker Park Caretaker’s lodge was designed in 1929 by Austin area architect Hugo F. Kuehne and built later that year before the city’s landmark swimming hole, Barton Springs, opened for the season. The first known resident caretaker, Buster Robinson, and his family moved into the lodge in 1935. The lodge was occupied by the caretakers or superintendents of the park until 2010, including Buster’s son Jack who also raised his children there from 1964-1978. Veneered in local Texas stone, it still sits in its original place just north of the Barton Springs Pool.

I completed the National Register of Historic Places nomination for this structure, which had originally only been included in a 1997 historic district. This involved researching the history of the structure's architect, builders and inhabitants by conducting archival research. In addition to this nomination, I assisted the Austin Parks Department in completing an application for Historic Zoning and creating a landmarks plaque, prior to the Cottage's reopening this Spring as a Park Ranger's Headquarters.
