Before I dreamed of a master’s degree in anything, my father fit a hardhat to my head and took every opportunity to present me as his junior engineer. When he visited boiler rooms, I held the flashlight steady. He made sure I understood the way the boiler worked, and why steam was important. We’d point out buildings that still had coal chutes, stop together at grade crossings to wave at passing locomotives, and he spun me tales of the early railroads moving pioneers west.

After co-founding an urban photography blog in high school, I realized my interest in history had expanded to include even those unglamorous corners of urbanism and infrastructure. I began to wonder about the lives of the people who had created my city’s first brick sewers. Why hadn’t anybody done archaeology down there? It was invigorating to be able to ask these questions with images, and to share my passion with others. It also wasn’t long after I started documenting my surroundings in photos that I began to notice how quickly they were changing. On one hand, the constant evolution of the city was what made it so fascinating to photograph. On the other, I was seeing far fewer coal chutes. I had looked forward to pointing such details out to my own children, and I despaired at the loss. I watched landmarks such as the 1881 Pillsbury A Mill sit vacant on the Minneapolis skyline, while the debate about its worth buzzed in the background. How can a structure so integral to the city’s ancestry and landscape be so difficult to find a suitable use for?

I am passionate not only about saving and rehabilitating historic places but sharing their value with the community around them. I believe my background in archaeology allows me to bring a unique perspective to the table, and I most look forward to any opportunities I may have to study the ways in which industrialism shaped modern American cities, and how to best reuse industrial sites as new community spaces. By reusing such spaces we instill history as an integral piece of our modern lives, and we can save the coal chutes.
