I am a millennial. Now, I know, all of this might seem very shocking, but I'm not gonna give you much time to get over it. I'm a millennial, and I love so many of the things that my fellow millennials love. I'd rather watch a GIF than a video. I love craft beer, I've taken photos of my feet in interesting places, and my boyfriend and I have now purchased a Suburu. And, like many twenty-something women, I have a Pinterest account full of "Inspiration."

I love Pinterest. While in college, I downloaded things that inspired me into poorly titled desktop files like "water" or "collected images." They're still strewn across multiple flash drives and external hard drives, along with half-written poems about pirates. Now, I pin things to my board. And many people then re-pin the images from my board. I've played a critical role in sending images and ideas back out into the ether.

But I have to say that in seemingly every case, the things I want to re-pin seem to come from other reposting sites (Tumblr) or similar blog sites that were not the original source of that content. In many cases, I cannot track down the original content creater. I know I am one of the few who (usually) try.

Inspiration is awesome! I crave it. I love seeing images on Pinterest and Tumblr that excite me. My 'Photographic Ideas' board (no, I haven't gotten better at naming things) is one of the things that makes me want to venture out and create art. It makes me want to speak louder, think harder, and do more. And I don't know where 75% of that content came from.

I have three half-composed inspiration posts in the queue for this blog. It's been remarkably hard to put them together because I want to make sure that I give each of the artists that inspire me the credit they deserve. I want to be a part of the online inspiration that brings me joy. I want to create a collection of impeccable gritty floral studies, and sophisticated urban portraits and show them off to you.
